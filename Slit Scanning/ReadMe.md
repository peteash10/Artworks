#Slit-Scanning

I've been fascinating with slit-scan photography for a very long time. Arguably this began when I discovered the photocopier in the 1980s but a useful starting point would probably be Golan Levin's [Informal Catalogue of Slit-Scan Video Artworks and Research](http://flong.com/texts/lists/slit_scan/) which he's been compiling for over a decade. I came across it at least five years ago. 

Slit-scan is something I find myself returning to again and again for the aesthetics but also the way it allows us to bring time into the photograph (or out of the movie) in new ways. 

Here's a selection of my slit-scan works.

All experiments must be applied to Koyaanisqatsi at some point.

I gave a talk in front of static slides and wondered what would happen if I slitscanned it.

Part of a series of [Slitscanned Presidents](https://vimeo.com/album/3193218) where I also manipulated the audio as a spectrographic image, but the visuals were more interesting.

Taking photo sequences from a [Cross City Walk](http://xcw.org.uk) and slitscanning the edges to create a tunnel.

As the slit-scanner moves across the photograph that pixel-wide column is stretched across the whole image in a translucent layer. Simultaneously photos are fed through an ANS synth, treating them as a sound spectrograph and producing a unique drone.
