# Speculative Cameras

_by [Pete Ashton](http://peteashton.com)_

*This project has morphed into my as-yet-untitled [2017 body of work](https://github.com/peteash10/2017-body-of-work).*

In March 2016 I started an 18 month long project to research and build cameras that have never existed before. It forms the basis of my [Birmingham Open Media fellowship](http://www.bom.org.uk/bom-fellows/) and was formally launched at the Fellows Seminar there on March 7th. Here's the talk I gave:

It's mostly my attempting to turn [Vilem Flusser's theory](https://lareviewofbooks.org/essay/its-a-mistake-to-mistake-content-for-content) of how systems inform technical images into a useful platform for inventing new cameras, and I'm really pleased with how it went. There were some good questions afterwards and I've had a lot of interesting conversations, particularly from people studying my Big Wall Of Inspiration in the BOM gallery.

A week later I gave the follow-up talk on the Politics of Cameras at the [Birmingham Pecha Kucha night](http://pkbham.uk/pecha-kucha-birmingham-vol-12/).

This deals with the "why" of the project, which I didn't have time to get into a BOM, specifically that images have power and that power lies in the systems that produce them, from drones to selfies. This political aspect is what will make this project worth doing.

The timescale for the Speculative Cameras is long, but I know from experience that a year will fly by, so I've sketched out a plan.

Through the summer of 2016 I have enough savings to give myself time to prototype some devices and apply for some funding.

I've been offered a scholarship for [Golan Levin's Experimental Capture](http://golancourses.net/capture2016/) workshop in Colorado in July which I'll be attending.

In November I'm going to Austria for a month for the [Goodbye Wittgenstein residency](http://a3projectspace.org/index.php/project/goodbye_wittgenstein/). This will be a diversion from the cameras and serve as a palate cleanser, but will hopefully inform the project long-term with some fresh thinking.

In Spring 2017 I hope to have a small number of working cameras that can make images.

In Autumn 2017 I will be having a solo show at [BOM](http://www.bom.org.uk/) featuring cameras, or maybe just a camera, which the public will be able to use.

Within that framework I hope for lots of other things to happen, collaborations and visits. But the show in 18 months is the goal. If you're interested or would like to get involved please get in touch. I'd love to hear from you!
